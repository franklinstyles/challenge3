# Movie Ticketing System
======================

## Overview

This is a simple movie ticketing system built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The system allows users to view a list of movies, buy tickets, and delete movies.

## Features

* Display a list of movies with their titles, runtime, showtime, and description
* Allow users to buy tickets for a movie
* Update the ticket count in real-time
* Allow administrators to delete movies from the list
* Refresh the movie list after deletion (optional)

## Building Details

* The system uses the Fetch API to retrieve a list of movies from a local server
* The movie data is stored in a JSON file on the server
* The system uses JavaScript to dynamically update the UI and handle user interactions
* The UI is built using HTML and CSS

## Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
   ```bash
      https://github.com/franklinstyles/challenge3
    ```  
2. Start the local server by running `node server.js` (assuming you have Node.js installed)
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser
4. View the list of movies and interact with the system

## Issues

* The system does not handle errors well
* The system does not store any user data or preferences

## Future Development

* Implement error handling and logging
* Add authentication and authorization mechanisms
* Store user data and preferences
* Improve the UI and user experience
* Add more features (e.g., movie ratings, reviews, etc.)
